# plugin.tree-generator — bounded third-party review

QOI C: Dominic Szablewski (2021), MIT. Copied Go QOI names Xavier-Frédéric Moulet; full independent upstream MIT text retained even when the helper is source-distributed but not linked. No assertion of an original port revision.

Go go.mod/go.sum bind cm@v0.3.0 and wit-bindgen-go tool@v0.7.0 plus declared indirect modules; complete cached module LICENSE/COPYING/NOTICE files retained, including nested terms. SDK helper imports and Go standard library are runtime inputs; not every indirect generator dependency is linked.

Generated C component ABI glue uses flake-pinned wit-bindgen v0.57.1 (2e00369a643c0c8048b8636401e36b0cbf2dfb05); complete upstream MIT/Apache choices retained, not assumed owner-authored glue. Generated Go ABI bindings use the separately inventoried wit-bindgen-go module tool.

C build uses wasm32-wasip2-clang (WASI SDK 33), wasi-libc 161b3195fc2558d2b1ba3eb9ffae3b2b47407623 and LLVM/compiler-rt 4434dabb69916856b824f68a64b029c67175e532, matching local SDK VERSION/clang evidence. Direct Preview2 C linkage does NOT imply an injected Preview1 adapter. Go uses TinyGo wasip2 runtime and its component assembly; any standard Preview1→Preview2 adapter must be identified by actual build/module evidence. Wasmtime adapter terms retained conditionally, not claimed as a C link input. Runtime reachability/adapter exact source and digest still require actual hosted evidence. The retained wasi-io 3983fe1… Apache-LLVM text is a newer comparison only, NOT the license of the vendored v0.2.0 specification bytes.

WASI Preview 2 specification v0.2.0; wasi:cli@0.2.0, wasi:clocks@0.2.0, wasi:filesystem@0.2.0, wasi:random@0.2.0, wasi:sockets@0.2.0 and wasi:io@0.2.0. Copyright © 2019-2023 the Contributors to the WASI Specification, published by the WebAssembly Community Group under the W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Source: WebAssembly/WASI 70214b878af4ce45889b4ad9d26a7ac98db8931b, preview2/. The official umbrella root LICENSE.md explicitly covers these specification definitions; all 29 distinct WIT files / 69 occurrences are byte-identical to that licensed v0.2.0 snapshot and the historical WIT inventory. Only WIT, upstream notices, frozen full CLA and acquisition metadata are distributed; no unrelated original-archive scripts/readmes are covered. Original standalone archive URLs/hashes remain historical in UPSTREAM.json and the prior vendor inventory is retained separately, not retroactively relicensed. No API/package-version change or Apache grant is inferred.

Complete umbrella notice, original IO notice and frozen full W3C CLA HTML are retained in LICENSES; full CLA SHA-256 14e40793d59248a0af6ecf2b6e9f705e4a950a21fe4c3365e4b5fa319df4e15f, acquisition URL https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/ (mutable URL, frozen bytes). CLA §2.1 grants reproduction, derivatives, sublicensing, distribution and implementation of Contributions; §2.2 requires Specification name/version attribution for derivatives, supplied here and required in generated-binding/candidate/tooling notices. §1 excludes source code outside the Specification. §3/§12.8 retain RF patent commitments, reciprocity/suspension conditions, not an unconditional Apache patent grant. Contributor execution/withdrawals and Final Specification agreement coverage are not independently certified; no FSA or patent clearance is asserted. These reliance limitations are not discovered permission defects. Newer wasi-io Apache-LLVM text is comparison-only, never exact v0.2.0 authority.

## Limits

- Working-tree source comparison, not an original-authorship, original-import, or all-history certificate. Owner Apache approval applies only to owner-controlled contributions.
- Exact prepared repository bytes are bound below, including build inputs/lockfiles/tests. No current build, enabled-feature graph, linked-code reachability, adapter digest, or final WASM/ZIP contents are certified by this source audit.
- Pinned upstream license comparisons establish readable terms, not the version of every historical imported fragment. Newly discovered identifiable missing permissions remain blockers; historical lineage uncertainty alone does not veto approved GAMS-authored work.
- Build tools (jco, wit-bindgen, C#/Odin parity runners) are not automatically distributed runtime code. Go module inventory conservatively includes generator-only dependencies. Final linked runtime and standard adapters require hosted build evidence.

## Identifiable permission blockers

None identified in this selected prepared closure. This does not clear existing record blockers, new findings, or final artifact review.
